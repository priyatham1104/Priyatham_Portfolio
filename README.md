Some Interesting Works

# [Project 1: Face Mask Recognition](https://github.com/priyatham1104/Face-mask-detection)
1. A simple Image classfication Task.
2. Use Open CV to obtain images into 3 cateogries with mask and no mask and no face.
3. Build a convolutional neural network to train on these pictures.
4. Use Open CV for real time Face mask detection.
