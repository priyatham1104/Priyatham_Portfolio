Some Interesting Works

# [Project 1: Face Mask Recognition](https://github.com/priyatham1104/Face-mask-detection)
1. A simple Image classfication Task.
2. Use Open CV to obtain images into 3 cateogries with mask and no mask and no face.
3. Build a convolutional neural network to train on these pictures.
4. Use Open CV for real time Face mask detection.

# [Project 2: Rock Paper scissors Spock Lizard](https://github.com/priyatham1104/Rock-Paper-scissors-spock-lizard)
1. A fun game to play with image classigfication.
2. Use Open CV to obtain images into 5 cateogries 
    a. lizard
    b. spock
    c. rock
    d. paper
    e. scissors
4. Build a convolutional neural network to train on these pictures.
5. Use Open CV for designing and playing the game
